This script checks the latest price for the tokens you hold in Binance or Pancakeswap and outputs a list of current values for each token / coin, a total value for all of them and a total profit / loss if you provide your initial investment value. 

**This is a work in progress.**

# Prerequisites

- python3 : 
https://www.python.org/downloads/
- The python `requests` module (https://pypi.org/project/requests/).  
- The python `json` module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html). 
Run the following commands in a terminal to install the modules. 
```
pip install requests
```` 
```
pip install json
```

# How to use 
**IMPORTANT** : Only tokens from PancakeSwap and Binance are currently supported. 

1. Download the `crypto.py` file and put it in a folder on your computer. 

2. Open the file and replace `0000` value for the `INVESTED` variable to your invested amount. 

3. Create a text file in the same folder as the script called `holdings.txt`.

For each token you hold, create a row in the `holdings.txt` file. 

For a token you hold from binance, the row should follow this convention:   
`{name}:Binance:{amount-that-you-hold}`

Example row for a token you hold from binance:  
```
ETH:Binance:0.04179
```

For a token you hold from PancakeSwap, the row should follow this convention:
`{name}:PancakeSwap:{token-adress}:{amount-that-you-hold}`
Example row for a token you hold from PancakeSwap:  
```
BONFIRE:PancakeSwap:0x5e90253fbae4dab78aa351f4e6fed08a64ab5590:193904333.915533
```

Example of `holdings.txt` file: 

```
BNB:Binance:0.284112
GMR:PancakeSwap:0x0523215dcafbf4e4aa92117d13c6985a3bef27d7:228120850.69031771
ADA:PancakeSwap:0x3ee2200efb3400fabb9aacf31297cbdd1d435d47:94.870701
```

4. To run the script, open a terminal and run the following command in the same folder as the script:
```
python3 crypto.py
```

# Good to know
- Some tokens will not have price information available in the used APIs, then you will be prompted to input the value you hold manually or skip that token. 
- You can comment out a row in your holders file if you trade a lot back and forth. Just comment out a row with `#` like this: 
```
#BNB:Binance:0.284112
```
and the script will skip that token. 

# TODO:
- I will add support for more exchanges going forward. 
- I will enable support to read the amount of a token you hold from your wallet since some tokens give reflections and grow due to tokenomics.
- I will create a virtual environment for this project so that you don't have to download every module for itself when using the script.
